Thank you for downloading!

​Simple 2D animated sprites for ghost and skull, edited into a sprite sheet and ready for animation in your games or projects.

Ghost is 52 x 64 pixels

Skull is 44 x 40 pixels

They can be easily imported and split into individual sprites by slicing with these values.

PSD is available upon request, though I do request a $1 donation for this.

Background used is from my other asset pack which can be found here: https://fatalgaming.itch.io/pixeltextures​

Feel free to use all assets free of charge in any project you like. No attribution is required. This is my first 2D Sprite asset, so let me know what you think!

Please do not redistribute assets while claiming them as your own.

Donations are appreciated but not required :)
